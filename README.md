# The Ultimate Everything Remote

Modifications made to the Everthing Remote to make it the Ultimate Everythign Remote
- Pogo pins for charging
- Removed one of the hardware pull up resistors and added a voltage divider circuit in its place, still retaining button use but now also accuarate battery metrics
- Removed GPIO15 Button and replaced with a WS2812 LED pixel for notifications (And a built in flash light mode)
- Enablded contious press mode on specific buttons to enable holding volume up or down

I'm still working on files and will get them uploaded when done.
